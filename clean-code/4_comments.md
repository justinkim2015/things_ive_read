# Comments
Comments are necessary evil, they must be written when we fail to express ourselves in code.

## Comments do not make up for bad code
- Instead of commenting bad code to make it understandable, just clean it up!

## Good Comments
- Legal Comments: We need to have comments about copyright and authorship statements.
- Informative Comments: It can be useful to provide basic information with a comment, for example about return types or what a bit of regex is matching
- Explanation of Intent:The comment should explain the WHY rather than the WHAT.
- Warning of consequences: If something negative or time-consuming could happen if ran, a comment can be useful
- TODO Comments

## Bad Comments
- Mumbling: writing comments without a real reason
- Redundant Comments: Basically explaining what the code is doing, it's repeating and unnecessary.
- Misleading Comments: If a comment isn't precise enough to be accurate or simply wrong, it can cause future headaches.
- Noisy Comments
- Position Markets
- Closing Brace Comments
- Commented out code
- Attributions and bylines
- HTML Comments
- Nonlocal information
- Too much information
- Inobvious Conecction
- Function Headers
- Javadocs in Nonpublic code

# Screaming Architecture
```
When you look at the top-level directory structure, what does the architecture of your system scream?
```

## The Purpose of an Architecture
- Good architectures are centered on use cases.
- Additionally, good architecture allows decisions about frameworks, databases, web servers, and other tools to be deferred and delayed.

## Frameworks are Tools, Not Ways of Life
- When using frameworks consider the trade-offs you are making when you use it.
- Do not blindly trust the devotees (the people writing about) of the framework.

## Testible Architectures
- If your architecture is about the use cases, you should be able to unit-test the use cases without the framework in place.

## Takeaways
- When people look at your repository, people should know right away what your system is about, it should scream it at them.
- Don't blindly trust in frameworks, and once again, defer these tooling decisions to as late as possible.

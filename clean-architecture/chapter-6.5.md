# Design Principles

## SOLID Principles
These tell us how to arrange our functions and data structures into classes, and how those classes should be interconnected.

```
A class is simply a coupled grouping of functions and data. 
```

The goals of these principles are to create a software structure that:
1. Tolerates changes
2. Is easy to understand
3. Is the basis of components that can be used in many software systems

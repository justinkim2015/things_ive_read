# SRP: The Single Responsibility Principle

```
A module should have one, and only one, reason to change.
```

As systems are changed to satisfy users and stakeholders, those users and stakeholders are the reason to change.  Therefore the statement may be paraphrased as:

```
A module should be responsible to one, and only one, user or stakeholder
```

However, there may be several users or stakeholders therefore the final version will be:

```
A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor
```

**A module is a cohesive set of functions and data structures**

## Takeaways
The SRP is generally about functions and classes.

## Design vs Architecture
- They are the same.
- Generally design is referred to as low-level decisions where architecture is more high-level, however, in practice these are all part of the same whole.

## The Goal?
*The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system*

## Important Takeaways
- clean is faster then messy
- you won't go back and refactor that code
- you need to know what clean architecture is to design it
